/*
 * Temperature/vibration protocol — public entry point.
 *
 * The protocol is a length-prefixed JSON message stream carried over the
 * USB CDC-ACM transport (proto=2, role="accessories", device_id="temp"). It
 * exposes the ambient temperature/humidity and the vibration figures so a
 * desktop app translates them into ASCOM Alpaca and a UI. See README.md in this
 * folder for the wire contract.
 *
 * proto_init() must be called after usb_cdc_init(): it wires the CDC receive
 * stream to the frame parser.
