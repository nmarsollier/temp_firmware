# temp_firmware — Ambient temperature, humidity and vibration

Measures the ambient temperature/humidity and the telescope vibration. This board
hosts only the two sensors (SHT31 + ADXL345) on the shared I2C bus; the focuser and
the fan live in their own boards (`eaf_firmware` and `fan_firmware`).

## Functionality

- Ambient temperature and relative humidity (SHT31-D over I2C).
- Dew point (computed from ambient temperature and humidity).
- Telescope vibration (ADXL345 over I2C): per-axis demeaned RMS in m/s².

No 12 V sensor, no LEDs and no buttons — it is a sensor module only.

| `vibration` | Per-axis movement figures (demeaned RMS in m/s²) from the ADXL345. | — |
| `environment` | Ambient temp/humidity from the SHT31 + dew point. | — |
| `usb_cdc` | USB CDC-ACM transport (TinyUSB). | — |

## Hardware

| Component | Part |
|---|---|
| Microcontroller | ESP32-S3 <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8L7MQ9> |
| Ambient temp/humidity | SHT31-D <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GZZ9W7CK> |
| Accelerometer | ADXL345 |

## Ambient temperature and humidity — SHT31

- I2C bus, usual address 0x44 (`SHT31_ADDR`).
- SDA/SCL are shared with the ADXL345.
- Must be placed in a ventilated area, away from the ESP32 and regulator heat.
- Provides ambient temperature and humidity (for the dew point, reported to the
  gateway).

## ADXL345 accelerometer

- I2C address `ADXL345_ADDR`.
- Measures telescope vibrations.
- Encapsulated with the temperature/humidity sensor, mounted on the telescope tube.
- Initially statistics only, reported to the gateway. Could later analyze mount
  problems and tracking quality.

## Communication

USB-CDC with JSON messages. Provides the ambient temperature/humidity/dew point and
the vibration figures. The Go gateway (`mount_panel`) implements the Alpaca
ObservingConditions V2 interface (and the ambient-temperature switch channel) on top
of this link.

## Alpaca

The Go interface (`mount_panel`) exposes the ambient temperature, humidity and dew
point through the Alpaca ObservingConditions V2 interface.
